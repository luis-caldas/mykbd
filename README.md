# Keyboards

My `JSON` keyboard configurations to be compiled with `QMK` at [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm)

With excepition of `Keychron` keyboards which are [`VIA`](https://usevia.app)

The `HHKB Bluetooth` was configured with `TMK` at [TMK Keymap Editor](http://www.tmk-kbd.com/tmk_keyboard/editor/unimap/?hhkb_rn42)
